### How does it work?
Basically, CS2 is streaming data to local app-server, that transforms data and then load it to local webpage.

### installation
- Download and install node.js
- Download this repo somewhere
- /cfg/gamestate_integration_observerspectator.cfg needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS2 location
- CS2 needs to run on Fullscreen Windowed 
- After running CS2 and connecting to match (or replaying a demo, you can use this in it too)
- Start RUN file (.bat for Windows, .sh for Linux)
- Copy the given link from terminal and paste it in any browser to access the hud
- Go to create match select team then press save & force refresh HUD
- Go to match tab copy the link from browser
